# Python 101, 2nd Edition Book Code

Code examples from the book, [Python 101](https://leanpub.com/py101) 2nd Edition by Michael Driscoll. 

You can get early access to the book on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/py101) as well as all updates as they come out. The book will be finished by **September 2020**.

The first dozen or so chapters will have [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) rather than simple code examples. You can run the examples in your browser by using this link: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/driscollis/python101code/master). Then navigate to each chapter and open the Jupyter Notebook,
